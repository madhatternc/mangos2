These are the SQL schema for creating the MaNGOS2 databases. The SQL files are
mostly empty as this is NOT meant to be a complete database, but rather a
skeleton on which everybody can grow his own meat. However, the goal is to
have at least something with which MaNGOS2 will at least run.

The idea is to have four separate databases:
* character: one for character data storage,
* data: one for basic world data,
* realmlist: one for authentication and realm data storage,
* worldserver: and one for world state storage.

However, for simple configurations they can be merged into one, as the table
names do not clash.

To import these SQL databases easily, there's a script in src/tools called
mysql_import, which will do the dirty work for you.

Make sure, you do edit the mysql_info file to enter your local MySQL account
data.
