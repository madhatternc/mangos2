== Introduction ==
The Voice Chat server is a UDP server, which listens on an UDP socket on port
3724 for connections from the game client.

The server provides audio channels for the various in-game chat channels which
are served by the world server. Thus upon startup, the voice chat server will
open a TCP socket on which world servers can connect and maintain their voice
chat sessions for the various chat channels.

== Supported audo protocol ==
The audio protocol for the voice chat server yet has to be defined. Further
investigation on optimal protocols with a good balance in terms of quality and
speed is required.

== Supported opcodes ==
The list of opcodes for voice chat is currently unknown and needs to be defined.

== Notice ==
This is Captain Placeholder speaking: a minimal framework for an UDP based voice
chat server is coming soon.
