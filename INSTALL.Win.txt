== Installation Instructions ==
This documents describes the installation process for MaNGOS2 on Windows
using Visual C++. This includes Visual C++ 2005 (Express Edition working).

=== Configuring ===
MaNGOS2 uses the Visual C++ compiler to build the binaries. If you do not
have Visual C++, a free Express Edition of Visual C++ 2005 is available at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/.

Visual C++ 2003 Toolkit provides an alternative command line environment,
but as of writing this document, the toolkit has been replaced by the VC++
2005 Express Edition and only is available from some download mirrors.

There are several programs and libraries required in order to compile MaNGOS2
successfully:

 * zlib development package (headers) are required, as we use them for data
   compression.
 * MySQL development package (headers) are required, because we are using
   this backend for storing all data.
 * OpenSSL development package (headers) are required, because we are using
   them for authenticating the game client.

If you do not have all these dependencies installed, you may download a huge
dependency package from the MaNGOS2 website.

There are four build configurations available for MaNGOS2.

 Release (Win32)

   This will build MaNGOS2 and all its' dependencies in Release mode, thus all
   information output useful to developers will be removed as well as debug
   data will not be included in the resulting binaries.

 Debug (Win32)
   If you use this option, the DEBUG_PRINTF macro and some other debugging
   macros will be enabled. This means you will get much more information about
   what goes on, so use this option if something doesn't work and you don't
   understand what happens.

 Release (Win64)

   This will build MaNGOS2 and all its' dependencies in Release mode, thus all
   information output useful to developers will be removed as well as debug
   data will not be included in the resulting binaries.
   This build will create binaries useable only under 64-bit versions of
   Windows.

 Debug (Win64)
   If you use this option, the DEBUG_PRINTF macro and some other debugging
   macros will be enabled. This means you will get much more information about
   what goes on, so use this option if something doesn't work and you don't
   understand what happens.
   This build will create binaries useable only under 64-bit versions of
   Windows.

=== Compiling ===
Well, it should be fairly simple if you got all the pre-requisites. Open the
"Build" menu and select "Batch Build". In the dialog, either select all
build configurations for "Release (Win32)" to build binaries for running
MaNGOS2 or select all build configurations for "Debug (Win32) to build
binaries suitable for running debug sessions.

If you have a problem during compilation, we can't tell you what to do.
Figure it out yourself. If we would know in advance what problems you would
encounter, we would fix it in advance, or put a warning message in configure
at least.

Until this development branch will be merged into the trunk of our
SubVersion repository, no support will be provided.

Thank you for understanding.

=== Installing ===
The build configuration will create an installation directory at the top level
tree of your source directory upon finishing the compilation process. E.g. if
you just have built Debug (Win32), you top level tree will contain the following
generated directory structure:

 * bin
   * Debug
     * Win32
       - mangos2-realmlist
       - mangos2-worldserver
       - realmserver.conf
       - worldserver.conf
       - libeay32.dll
       - libmySQL.dll
