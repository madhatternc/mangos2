This directory contains SQL scripts which perform various checks on the
world server database in order to retain integrity, and keep clean off
all test data.

== A few guidelines ==
All SQL scripts are named by combining the plural name of the object
types it deals with, followed by the action it performs.

== Script descriptions ==
* items-remove-non-protoitems.sql: This script will delete any item
  prototype from the `protoitem` table, which is not used by the
  default character templates defined in the `protochar` table.

  Currently we do use the names for armor, weapons, usable and consum-
  able items to delete all items that have different names. Of course,
  you could change the script to delete items not needed by items
  stats in order to get rid of using item names.
